## 2014 Review
Travelled to 10 different countries in Europe with Seb as the rider and myself as the pillion on his motorbike. Fell in love with [the Alps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0FPDgKVEtw). Did 4 trips from Singapore to Malaysia to [hunt waterfalls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCJ2m0K7rVU). The 4th one spanned over 3 days to Cameron Highlands. Skied twice - first at Niseko, Japan; then at Thredbo, Australia. Joined a group of astronomy enthusiasts in Mersing and spent 2 nights engaging in some spectacular stargazing and astrophotography.

Learnt node.js, python's scipy stack, front-end development, devops, databases, APIs. Read one novel. Freelanced for the year and earned a third of my usual salary from the previous year. 

Spend 2 months obsessed over a super nutritious liquid blend, [bentoblend](alyssaquek.blogspot.sg/2014/10/bentoblend-my-diy-soylent.html). I still drink this for breakfast a couple of times a week.

I had various depressing and lonely moments and various liberating and eye-opening moments. My perspective on life changed the most this year and I'll continue learning and working to my fullest.

## Don't just do, understand
Learning college/university mathematics was hard. I remember being bogged down by the mathematical symbols and definitions. I had memorised the process of solving equations without understanding how it worked. 

I do the same with machine learning - applying neural networks and gradient boosted trees without understanding how it transforms my data.

As Richard Feynman puts it: ["There is a difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something"](http://www.haveabit.com/feynman/2). This was also featured in the chapter _O Americano, Outra Vez_ of his book [Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5544.Surely_You_re_Joking_Mr_Feynman_) (I highly recommend reading it!).

My aim for this year is to read more on my new a kindle paperwhite (which I named R2-D2) and understand more about the world! I want to do more scientific Python, computer vision, GPU programming, web apps, blog more and get out more often.
